## Introduction
### What is Lab Mode? 
`Lab Mode` helps you further understand your health. You can run correlational anaylsis' on your data to help you find an answer to questions like : 
    1. If I increase my Deep sleep, does that increase my HRV?
    2. How is caffeine in the evening affecting my sleep?
    3. Do I sleep better in a cold room or a hot one? 
    4. How are these supplements affecting my body? 

Lab Mode is split into two parts : 
    1. Biometric relationships 
    2. Metrics + Tags
