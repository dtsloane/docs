Privacy is at the core of what we're building here at Cambrean. We believe your health data should be in your control, always. We are committed to protecting your sensive health data, which is why we do the following : 

    1. Once you disconnect your devices, all your data is removed from our database 
    2. Once you delete your account, all of your data is removed from our database 

<Tip>
We never share your data with anyone. You're in full control of your information.

## Storing your data 
### Encryption
We use [Evervault](https://evervault.com/) to encrypt all data at REST and in transit. Furthermore, we encrypt the data prior to storing it it in our database.

>This means your data is always anonymous in our database

### GDPR & HIPAA Compliance 
We are GDPR compliant and are working towards HIPAA compliance. We follow strict data protection laws and regulations to ensure your personal data is safe and secure.

### Data collection 
We collect data from your wearable device, including but not limited to heart rate, sleep patterns, and physical activity. We use this data to provide insights that can help you improve your health and wellness. We do not share or sell your data with any third party. 

### Data Deletion 
If you choose to disconnect your wearable device or delete your account, we automatically delete all of your personal data from our database.

You are always in control. 

## Security 
### SSO Login 
Single Sign On `(SSO)` reduces the number of attack surfaces because users only log in once each day and only use one set of credentials.

Reducing login to one set of credentials improves enterprise security. When employees have to use separate passwords for each app, they usually donâ€™t.

### Google Authentication 
You can sign up or login using your Google Account, to ensure that only authorized individuals have access to your data.

## Third Party Services 
### Vercel 
Cambrean uses server-less functions from vercel, while being built on top of typescrypt & Next.js. Vercel is SOC2 Type 2
