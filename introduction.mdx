## Getting Started
### Onboarding 
- After signing up, you should get an invite to Cambrean `via email`. Now it's time to login and go through the onboarding process. Struggling to login? <a href="mailto:hello@cambrean.com">Contact us.</a>
- You can login through your Google Account, or we can send a `SSO` link to your email address
- Fill out the information fields while you're going through the onboarding process. Now it's time to centralize your data! 

### Connecting your Wearables / Data sources 
1. Change `name` in the `mint.json` file to your company or product's name.
2. Update `logo` folder with the light and dark version of your logo (can be svg or png).
3. Populate the `colors` object with colors that match your brand
4. Change the `favicon.png` with an image of the favicon
5. Update `footerSocials` with the right `[platform]: [url]` key-value pair
